        <p>In the proposed system for semantic segmentation in autonomous vehicles, the U-Net architecture serves as a
critical component for accurate and efficient scene understanding from camera images. U-Net, originally
developed for biomedical image segmentation, has been adapted and extensively utilized in various computer
vision tasks, including semantic segmentation.</p>

<p>The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path for feature extraction followed by an expansive path for
precise localization and segmentation. The contracting path employs convolutional and pooling layers to capture
hierarchical features while reducing spatial dimensions. Skip connections are established between
corresponding layers in the contracting and expansive paths to retain high-resolution feature maps, enabling
precise localization of objects and semantic details.</p>

<p>In the context of autonomous vehicles, U-Net is trained with annotated images to learn to segment different
classes of objects such as roads, vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles. Post-training, the deployed U-Net model
processes real-time camera images captured by the vehicle's sensors, providing pixel-level segmentation masks
indicating the semantic category of each pixel in the scene.</p>

<p>By integrating U-Net within the proposed system, the autonomous vehicle gains the capability to understand its
surroundings comprehensively, facilitating decision-making processes such as path planning, obstacle
avoidance, and navigation in complex environments. U-Net's robustness, efficiency, and accuracy make it a
valuable asset in enhancing the perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles, contributing to safer and more
reliable autonomous driving systems.
